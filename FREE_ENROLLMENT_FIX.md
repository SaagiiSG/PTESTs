# Free Enrollment Payment Error Fix

## Problem
When trying to enroll in free tests or courses, users were getting a payment error. The root cause was missing environment variables for NextAuth authentication, and also invalid test data in the database.

## Root Causes
1. **Authentication Issue**: The authentication was failing because the following environment variables were missing:
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL`
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`

2. **Test Data Validation Issue**: The test data in the database had invalid values:
   - Missing required `embedCode` field
   - Invalid `testType` value of `Demo` (not in allowed enum values: `['Talent', 'Aptitude', 'Clinic', 'Personality']`)

This caused the session to not be properly established, resulting in a 401 Unauthorized error when trying to access the free enrollment API, and later a 500 validation error when the API tried to save the test data.

## Solution

### 1. Add Missing Environment Variables
Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
```

For production, use your actual domain:
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-production-secret-key
```

### 2. Fix Test Data Validation
The test data has been updated to have valid values:
- `testType` changed from `'Demo'` to `'Talent'`
- Added required `embedCode` field
- All other required fields are properly set

### 3. Restart Development Server
After adding the environment variables, restart your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 4. Test the Fix
1. Navigate to `/test-auth` to check your authentication status
2. Try enrolling in a free test or course
3. The enrollment should now work without payment errors

## Verification
You can verify the fix by:

1. **Checking auth configuration:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-auth-config
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"success","message":"NextAuth configuration is valid"}`

2. **Testing free enrollment API:**
   - Log in to your account
   - Navigate to a free test or course
   - Click "Enroll for Free"
   - Should work without errors

3. **Using the auth check script:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/checkAuthSetup.js
   ```

## Additional Improvements Made

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added better error logging in the free purchase API
- Improved error messages in the PaymentOptionsModal
- Added debugging information to help identify issues

### Better Response Handling
- Fixed response parsing in the PaymentOptionsModal
- Added proper success callback with unique codes
- Improved error message display

### Data Validation
- Fixed test data validation issues
- Ensured all required fields are properly set
- Updated test data to use valid enum values

## Files Modified
- `app/api/public/purchase-free/route.ts` - Added comprehensive logging
- `components/PaymentOptionsModal.tsx` - Improved error handling and response parsing
- `app/test-auth/page.tsx` - Created authentication test page
- `app/test-free-enrollment/page.tsx` - Updated to use correct test data
- `.env` - Added missing environment variables
- Database - Fixed test data validation issues

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` are set in your environment
2. Use the auth configuration test endpoint to verify setup
3. Test authentication flows regularly
4. Monitor server logs for authentication errors
5. Ensure test data follows the correct schema validation rules
6. Use the auth check script to verify environment setup

## Error Resolution Summary
- ✅ **401 Unauthorized**: Fixed by adding missing environment variables
- ✅ **500 Validation Error**: Fixed by correcting test data schema issues
- ✅ **Free Enrollment**: Now working correctly for both tests and courses
