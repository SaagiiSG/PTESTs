## Quick Fix for SharePoint

If you want to stick with SharePoint, ask your client to:

1. **Make the video public:**
   - Go to SharePoint → Video → "..." → "Manage access"
   - Add "Everyone" with "Read" permissions
   - Or set to "Anyone with the link can view"

2. **Use public embed:**
   - Look for "Public embed" or "Anonymous access" option
   - Use that embed code instead

3. **Alternative: Create a public SharePoint site**
   - Set up a public-facing SharePoint site
   - Upload videos there
   - Use those embed codes

## Implementation

Your course platform supports **all** these embed codes perfectly! Just paste any of these embed codes into the "Video URL" field and they'll work immediately.
