# Purchase Data Sync Issue - Analysis and Fix

## Problem Description

The profile pages (`/profile/coursehistory` and `/profile/testhistory`) were showing different data than what was actually stored in the database. This was because the application was using **two different systems** for tracking purchases that were **not synchronized**:

### Two Purchase Systems

1. **User Model System** (Primary)
   - Stores purchases in `user.purchasedCourses` and `user.purchasedTests` arrays
   - Used by: `/api/purchase/route.ts`, `/api/public/purchase-free/route.ts`
   - Fast access for checking ownership
   - **No timestamps** - just arrays of IDs

2. **Purchase Collection System** (Secondary)
   - Stores individual purchase records in a separate `Purchase` collection
   - Used by: `/api/profile/purchase-history` (profile pages)
   - Includes timestamps and analytics data
   - **Not being updated** by purchase APIs

## Root Cause

The purchase APIs (`/api/purchase/route.ts` and `/api/public/purchase-free/route.ts`) were **only updating the User model arrays** but **not creating Purchase collection records**. This meant:

- ‚úÖ Users could purchase items (stored in User model)
- ‚úÖ Profile pages tried to read from Purchase collection
- ‚ùå Purchase collection was empty/missing records
- ‚ùå Profile pages showed no data or incorrect data

## Data Analysis Results

Before the fix:
```
=== PURCHASE DATA SYNC ANALYSIS ===
Found 2 users with purchases in User model

User: Saran-Ochir . S
  User Model - Courses: 1, Tests: 5
  Purchase Collection Records: 5
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  MISMATCH - Purchase records don't match User model counts
  ‚ùå Missing tests in Purchase collection: 3
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Extra records in Purchase collection: 2

User: Baysaa
  User Model - Courses: 3, Tests: 0
  Purchase Collection Records: 3

=== OVERALL STATISTICS ===
Total User Model Purchases: 9
Total Purchase Collection Records: 8
Discrepancy: 1 records

üî¥ DATA SYNC ISSUE DETECTED!
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Data Synchronization
- Created scripts to sync existing User model purchases to Purchase collection
- Cleaned up extra/orphaned records in Purchase collection
- Ensured both systems have identical data

### 2. API Updates
Updated both purchase APIs to use **both systems simultaneously**:

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only updated User model
user.purchasedCourses.push(courseId);
await user.save();
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Update user model (fast access)
user.purchasedCourses.push(courseId);
await user.save();

// Create purchase record (analytics and history)
await Purchase.create({
  user: session.user.id,
  course: courseId,
  purchasedAt: new Date()
});
```

### 3. Files Modified
- `app/api/purchase/route.ts` - Added Purchase collection updates
- `app/api/public/purchase-free/route.ts` - Added Purchase collection updates
- Created sync and cleanup scripts

## Results After Fix

```
=== PURCHASE DATA SYNC ANALYSIS ===
Found 2 users with purchases in User model

User: Saran-Ochir . S
  User Model - Courses: 1, Tests: 5
  Purchase Collection Records: 6

User: Baysaa
  User Model - Courses: 3, Tests: 0
  Purchase Collection Records: 3

=== OVERALL STATISTICS ===
Total User Model Purchases: 9
Total Purchase Collection Records: 9
Discrepancy: 0 records

‚úÖ Data appears to be in sync
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Profile Pages Now Work Correctly**
   - Course history shows actual purchased courses
   - Test history shows actual purchased tests
   - Purchase timestamps are available

2. **Analytics Data Available**
   - Purchase collection can be used for analytics
   - Historical purchase data with timestamps
   - Better reporting capabilities

3. **Consistent Data**
   - Both systems stay in sync automatically
   - No more discrepancies between different parts of the app
   - Reliable purchase history

## Future Recommendations

1. **Consider Using purchaseUtils.js**
   - The existing `lib/purchaseUtils.js` has robust functions for handling both systems
   - Includes duplicate protection and transaction safety
   - Could replace the current purchase logic

2. **Add Purchase Timestamps to User Model**
   - Consider storing purchase dates in User model arrays
   - Would provide faster access to purchase history
   - Reduce dependency on Purchase collection for basic queries

3. **Database Indexes**
   - Add indexes on Purchase collection for better performance
   - Consider unique constraints to prevent duplicates

## Scripts Created

- `scripts/checkPurchaseDataSync.js` - Analyze sync status
- `scripts/syncPurchaseData.js` - Sync User model to Purchase collection
- `scripts/investigateExtraPurchases.js` - Find extra/orphaned records
- `scripts/cleanupExtraPurchases.js` - Clean up extra records

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified:
- ‚úÖ Data is now perfectly synced between both systems
- ‚úÖ Profile pages should show correct purchase history
- ‚úÖ New purchases will update both systems automatically
- ‚úÖ No data loss occurred during the sync process
